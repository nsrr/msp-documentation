## About

The Maternal Sleep in Pregnancy and the Fetus (MSPF) data were generated by standard overnight laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) that included an additional monitor for detecting and quantifying the fetal electrocardiogram (ECG), conducted on 106 women during the 36th week of pregnancy. The primary aims of this study were to: **1.** evaluate whether episodes of maternal sleep disordered breathing contemporaneously exert deleterious influences on the fetus, as indicated by fetal heart rate and variability, the primary metrics for evaluating antepartum well-being; and **2.** describe fetal heart rate and variability in relation to maternal sleep stages. A secondary aim was to evaluate whether fetuses of women with higher levels of sleep disordered breathing exhibited indicators of reduced neuromaturation. 

Eligibility was restricted to non-smoking women with pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m^2), without previously identified sleep disorders and absent significant conditions that jeopardized the pregnant woman or fetus.  Common obesity-related conditions, including pre-existing or pregnancy-induced hypertension and diabetes, were not exclusion criteria. 

## PSG Scoring Methods

The raw data is hand scored and annotated by a Registered PSG Technologist (RPSGT) licensed in the state of MD, using American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring criteria with Rechtschaffen, A. and Kales, A. (1968) and respiratory analysis with 3% desaturations or arousals.

Sleep study scoring was based on Berry RB, Brooks R, Gamaldo CE, et al. The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specifications, Version 2.0. Darien, Illinois: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2012. Apnea was defined by an absence of airflow in the nasal and oronasal airflow ≥10s. Hypopnea was defined as a > 30% drop in airflow from baseline for ≥10s terminated by an arousal from sleep or  ≥3% fall in SaO2. 

## Data overview

**[PSG signals](:files_path:/PSG)** were collected using RemLogic 1.3 N7000 data acquisition system (Natus Medical, Broomfield, CO) 

**[Annotations](:files_path:/Annotations)** were exported by RemLogic into XML files. 

**[ECG](:files_path:/ECG)** were collected using Monica AN24 (Monica Healthcare, Nottingham UK). Fetal ECG data, particularly in pregnancies characterized by high BMI, are prone to signal artifact. In 22 of the PSGs (see below), fetal data were of insufficient quality to quantify fetal measures. However, files with only maternal PSG data are also included since the topic of maternal sleep during pregnancy is currently an area of significant inquiry.

Many of the remaining 84 files underwent procedures to interpolate or delete portions of fetal data, more information can be found in the publications under **relevant citations**.
